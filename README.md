The Middle Ages (1201 – 1800 AD) are an important chapter in the history of Bengali literature. The first 150 years of the Middle Ages (1201 – 1350 AD) are called the 'Dark Ages'. The name 'Dark Ages' is thought to be because literature was not written in Bengali under the influence of Turkish Muslim rule or no Bengali literary models written during that time have been discovered. The Muslim rule is blamed for the lack of Bengali literature being written due to various incidents such as the tendency of the Muslim rulers of that time to expand their empire, religious fanaticism, persecution, plunder and massacres. In fact, literary research and exploration is an ongoing process, and researchers are engaged in new discoveries with their inquisitive minds. Therefore, it is not right to conclude that Bengali literature was not written during that period called the 'Dark Ages'. 'Shunyapuran', 'Sek Shuvodaya', 'Prakrito Poingal' and 'Khanar Bachan' are clearly the fruits of the literary practice of the 'Dark Age'. 
The present article attempts to explore the literary practice of the 'Dark Age' and the nature of literary practice under Muslim patronage during that time.
